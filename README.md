# Ara3d

A set of open-source libraries for rapid application development in C# 

The Ara 3D library design goals are:

* Portability
* Simplicity
* Robustness 
* Flexibility 

Most libraries are .NET Standard 2.0, so that they can be used in a wide range of scenarios
such as for plug-ins. 

The libraries use functional programming idioms heavily. 

Inspired by the open-source libraries at [VIM](https:github.com/vimaec) and the .NET 
System libraries.
