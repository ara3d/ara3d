This is a file for the developers to ask questions to themselves, to others, and to track to-do items. 

This replaces complex and hard to use tools like JIRA.

## Bowerbird 

* The Bowerbird tests are empty, fix-it. 
* I would love a cleaning script to properly remove and clean all of the binary files. 
	* Why does Bowerbird copy the WPF demo exe to the Revit plug-ins folder? 
* This system will eventually use "3d-format-shootout" which is assumed to be a separate repo. 
	* This will need to be documented.
* If others work on this repository, I will want  
* I need a "forwarding" file for development work on Bowerbird.
	* This will say "read the files from here", where "here" 
* Bowerbird will concievably need some kind of configuration file. 
	* Where would that be? 
	* Would this not be something that makes sense for all applications? 
	* If so, shouldn't it be in the "applications folder"
* Do I want or need a standalone tool with UI for viewing and doing conversions of files? 
* Does bowerbird for Unity, kind of look like Unity scripts? 
* Bowerbird probably needs some kind of installation gu

### 2024-03-04

* I want to write an article about Ara3D.Mathematics
* I want to run my tests, and make it easier to run tests.
* Run tests in both debug and release build 
* Make a tagged release 
* Publish the stuff online 
* Maybe a version upgrading system would be nice
* Something to parse and update the various XML files. 
* Especially for versions and stuff.
* Need to do double builds I think ...? 
	* Because the proper version won't get picked up if changes happen but the version stays the same. 
	* Or do I need to do a "restore" step of some kind? 
* I want to work on the Geometry libraries, this is quite important.
