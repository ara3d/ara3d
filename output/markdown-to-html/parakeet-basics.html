<h1>The Basics of Using the Parakeet Text Parser in C#
</h1><br/>
<a href = 'https://github.com/ara3d/parakeet'>Parakeet</a>is a C# recursive descent library parser that uses operator overloading to make it easy to declare grammars 
in a readable format. It is an attempt to combine the advantages of parser generator tools and hand-rolled parsers.  
<br/>
Parakeet allows parsers to be defined using collections of parsing rules called grammars
which support operator overloading, thus parsers can be defined using an embedded domain specific language (DSL). 
<br/>
<h2>Points of Interest 
</h2><br/>
This is my fourth parsing library. My previous work can be found here;

</li>
which inspired a popular C++ library PEGTL (https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL/blob/main/doc/Changelog.md).

A very popular C++ parsing library called "PEGTL" was based on https://github.com/taocpp/PEGTL
<br/>
The <a href = 'https://github.com/cdiggins/plato'>Plato language implementation</a>is being built using Parakeet.

This article was authored in Markdown and converted into HTML using Parakeet.

<h2>Parsing Rules
</h2><br/>
A Parsing rule, also colliqually called a "parser", is an instance of a class derived from <code>Rule</code>which provides 
a <code>ParserState Match(ParserState state)</code>member function. 
<br/>
If the rule matches the input at the current position a new <code>ParserState</code>instance will be returned, otherwise
the function returns <code>null</code>. 
<br/>
<h2>Rule Combinator
</h2><br/>
A rule combinator creates a rule from other rules, similar to the core operations of a PEG grammar.
For example: <code>Choice</code>, <code>Sequence</code>, <code>ZeroOrMore</code>, <code>OneOrMore</code>, <code>NotAt</code>, etc. 
<br/>
There are several ways to create rules from other rules:
<br/>
<li>
Creating instances of the combinator classes (i.e., using <code>new</code>)
</li>
<li>
Calling one of the extension methods on <code>Rule</code>(e.g., <code>Optional()</code>, <code>NotAt()</code>, etc.)
</li>
<li>
Using operator overloading
    </li>
<li>
<code>+</code>=<code>Sequence</code>
    </li>
<li>
<code>|</code>=<code>Choice</code>
    </li>
<li>
<code></code>=<code>NotAt</code>
</li>
<br/>
For more information see the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar'>Wikipedia Article on Parsing Expression Grammars</a>.
<br/>
<h2>ParserState - The Input and Output of Rule Matching 
</h2><br/>
A ParserState is an immutable class that contains
<br/>
<li>
A pointer to the input - a string combined with look-up tables for quickly determining line and columns from indexes)
</li>
<li>
An offset from the beginning of the input string
</li>
<li>
A pointer to a linked list of  parse nodes  
</li>
<li>
A pointer to a linked list of error.   
</li>
<br/>
The fields of a <code>ParserState</code>instance are. 
<br/>
<pre lang = 'csharp'>
    public class ParserState 
{
    public readonly ParserInput Input;
    public readonly int Position;
    public readonly ParserNode Node;
    public readonly ParserError LastError;
    ...
}


</pre>
<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Definining Grammars
</h2><br/>
A Parakeet grammar is a class derived from the <code>Grammar</code>class. 
A class deriving from <code>Grammar</code>is required to provide an
overidden definition of the starting rule, and an optional whitespace rule.
<br/>
<li>
<code>abstract Rule StartRule {get;}</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>virtual Rule WS {get;}</code>
</li>
<br/>
Most rules are defined as computed properties, but can also be
functions or fields. It is up to the programmer.
<br/>
Top-level rules, those that are directly associated with properties in the grammar
are usually either <code>Node</code>rules or <code>Named</code>rules. 
<br/>
Named rules simply return the result of matching a child rule. They help
with grammar debugging and diagnostics. 
<br/>
<h2>Node Rules
</h2><br/>
A <code>Node</code>rule is liked a <code>NamedRule</code>in that it has a name but if matched successfully 
will return a <code>ParserState</code>that has at least two new <code>ParserNode</code>instances 
added to the linked list of nodes. One node points the beginning of the match, and the
other node points to the end.   
<br/>
A <code>ParserNode</code>looks like this:
<br/>
<pre lang = 'csharp'>
    public class ParserNode
{
    public readonly ParserRange Range;
    public readonly string Name;
    public readonly ParserNode Previous;
    ...
}


</pre>
<br/>
<br/>
A <code>ParserNode</code>linked list can be converted into a parse tree using the <code>ParseTreeNode ToParseTree()</code>method.
<br/>
<h2>Generating Parsing Errors with OnFail Rules  
</h2><br/>
There are several ways that a parsing rule might not match successfully:
<br/>
<li>
Returning <code>null</code>- a normal failure to match 
</li>
<li>
Not reaching the end of the input <code>ParserState.AtEnd == false</code>
</li>
<li>
Accumulating one or more <code>ParserError</code>in a linked list.
</li>
<br/>
A special rule called <code>OnFail</code>is used to generate <code>ParserError</code>. The <code>OnFail</code>rule is expected to appear as a child
of a <code>SequenceRule</code>. 
<br/>
It indicates that if the preceding child rules succeed, then any failure in the following rule will generate a <code>ParserError</code>.
The <code>OnFail</code>has an optional recovery rule as a parameter, allowing the parser to advance to the next location, such
as just past the end of statement, and attempt to continue. 
 <br/>
The following is a snippet from the <a href = 'https://github.com/ara3d/parakeet/blob/master/Parakeet.Grammars/PlatoGrammar.cs'>Plato grammar</a>
which demonstrates how the error handling and recovery occurs.  
<br/>
<pre lang = 'csharp'>
    public Rule AdvanceOnFail => 
    OnFail(Token.RepeatUntilPast(EOS | "}"));

public Rule IfStatement =>
    Node(Keyword("if") + AdvanceOnFail + ParenthesizedExpression + Statement + ElseClause.Optional());


</pre>
<br/>
<br/>
The <code>IfStatement</code>rule indicates that if the keyword <code>if</code>is matched then it must be followed 
by an expression enclosed in parenthesis, then a valid statement, anad then optionally an else clause. 
<br/>
If a failure occurs after the keyword <code>if</code>then we know there was a parsing error. The parser will consume tokens until 
it passes the end of statement (EOS) marker (<code>;</code>) or a closing brace (<code>}</code>). The IfStatement rule will return a 
valid ParserState, but it will have a new <code>ParserError</code>prepended to the linked list of errors.
