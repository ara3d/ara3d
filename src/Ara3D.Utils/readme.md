**Ara3D.Utils** is a collection of hundreds of useful functions and classes written in portable C# 
(C# version 7.3 and .NET Standard 2.0) with no dependencies.

This library is intended to reduce the amount of code we have to write, and to lighten the cognitive load 
making us more effective at programming. 

Much of the code was adapted from solutions to problems found on StackOverflow.com.
