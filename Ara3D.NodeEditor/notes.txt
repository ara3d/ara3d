* I want a snapping behavior for operators ... when they are being dragged and they get close, they snap.
* Behaviors should have settings. 
* In "ICanvas.cs" there are a lot of records, that need to be replaced with things from the 
geometry library. It is stupid to have two versions of that stuff.

Behavior example:

* On hover animation  
* On click animation 
* On dragging 
* On snapping 
* On cancel
* On undo ... move stuff back to where they were.
* Let things 
* Expand animation
* Shrink animation
